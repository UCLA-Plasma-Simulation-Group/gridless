This program contains sample codes for illustrating the basic structure
of a 2-1/2D Electromagnetic Gridless Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code, in
Fortran with C wrappers.  The codes have no diagnosics except for
initial and final energies.  Their primary purpose is to provide example
codes for physical science students learning about PIC codes.  They are
also intended as benchmark reference codes to aid in developing new
codes and in evaluating new computer architectures.

Gridless PIC codes are based on an exact solution of many interacting
particles, based on a fourier series.  The only approximations are a
finite time step and a truncation of the fourier series, as well as
round off errors.  The first gridless code was developed by John Dawson
in the 1960s for electrostatic systems, and is described in 
John M. Dawson, "The Electrostatic Sheet Model for a Plasma and its
Modification to Finite-Size Particles," Methods in Computational
Physics, volume 9, B. Alder, S. Fernback, and M. Rotenburg, Ed.
[Academic Press, New York, 1970, p. 1.

Traditional PIC codes are widely used in plasma physics.  They model
plasmas as particles which interact self-consistently via the
electromagnetic fields they themselves produce.  PIC codes generally
have three important procedures in the main iteration loop.  The first
is the deposit, where some particle quantity, such as a charge, is
accumulated on a grid via interpolation to produce a source density.
The gridless code calculates the fourier co-efficients directly without
using a grid or FFTs.  The second important procedure is the field
solver, which solves Maxwell’s equation or a subset to obtain the
electric and/or magnetic fields from the source densities.  The solver
in the gridless code is the same as a spectral solver in a traditional
PIC code, except that the number of fourier modes used can vary and the
fields remain in fourier space.  In a traditional PIC code, once the
fields are obtained in real space, the particle forces are found by
interpolation from the grid, and the particle co-ordinates are updated,
using Newton’s second law and the Lorentz force.  The gridless code
calculates the electric field at the particle's location directly from
the fourier series without use of a grid or interpolation.  Updating the
particle co-ordinates is the same as in a traditional PIC code.  The
particle processing parts dominate over the field solving parts in a
typical PIC application.  The gridless code is MUCH slower than a
traditional code, scaling as the number of particles TIMES the number
of fourier modes retained.  Gridless codes are much more accurate and do
not suffer from aliasing errors.  They are especially useful when
unusual errors are occurring in a traditional PIC code, or for very
precise calculations.

More details about traditional PIC codes can be found in the texts by
C. K. Birdsall and A. B. Langdon, Plasma Physics via Computer
Simulation, 1985, R. W. Hockney and J. W. Eastwood, Computer Simulation
Using Particles, 1981, and John M. Dawson, "Particle simulation of
plasmas", Rev. Mod. Phys. 55, 403 (1983).  Details about the
mathematical equations used in the gridless code and units used in this
code is given in the companion article, "Description of Electromagnetic
Spectral Code from the UPIC Framework" by Viktor K. Decyk, UCLA, in the
file EMModelsGL.pdf.

The code here uses the complete electromagnetic interaction, obtained by
solving Maxwell's equation.  The boundary conditions are periodic, only
electron species are included.

Particles are initialized with a uniform distribution in space and a
gaussian distribution in velocity space.  This describes a plasma in
thermal equilibrium.  The inner loop contains a current and charge
deposit, a transverse current procedure, Maxwell and Poisson solvers,
and a particle push procedure.  The final energy and timings are
printed.  A sample output file for the default input parameters is
included in the file output.

In more detail, the inner loop of the code contains the following
procedures in Fortran (C):

Deposit section:
   RDJPOST2GL (crdjpost2gl): relativistic current deposit, and update
                             position: x(t+dt/2)->x(t+dt)
   DJPOST2GL (cdjpost2gl): deposit current density, and update position:
                           x(t+dt/2)->x(t+dt)
   DPOST2GL (cdpost2gl): deposit charge density

                             space
   EPOIS23GL (cepois23gl): calculate initial transverse electric field 
                           in fourier space

                             electric fields

Particle Push section:
   ARBPUSH23GL (carbpush23gl): update relativistic particle co-ordinates
                               with smoothed electric and magnetic
                               fields:
                               x(t)->x(t+dt/2); v(t-dt/2)->v(t+dt/2)
   ABPUSH23GL (cabpush23gl): update particle co-ordinates with smoothed
                             electric and magnetic fields:
                             x(t)->x(t+dt/2); v(t-dt/2)->v(t+dt/2)

The inputs to the code are the grid parameters indx, indy, the particle
number parameters npx, npy, the time parameters tend, dt, the velocity
parameters vtx, vty, vtz, vx0, vy0, vz0, the inverse speed of light ci,
the flag relativity, and the fourier mode parameters nxhm, nyhm.

In more detail:
indx = exponent which determines length in x direction, nx=2**indx.
indy = exponent which determines length in y direction, ny=2**indy.
   These ensure the system lengths are a power of 2.
npx = number of electrons distributed in x direction.
npy = number of electrons distributed in y direction.
   The total number of particles in the simulation is npx*npy.
tend = time at end of simulation, in units of plasma frequency.
dt = time interval between successive calculations.
   The number of time steps the code runs is given by tend/dt.
   dt should be less than .45*ci for the electromagnetic code.
vtx/vty/vtz = thermal velocity of electrons in x/y/z direction.
   a typical value is 1.0.
vx0/vy0/vz0 = drift velocity of electrons in x/y/z direction.
ci = reciprocal of velocity of light
relativity = (no,yes) = (0,1) = relativity is used
nxhm/nyhm = number of fourier modes kept in x/y direction.

bpush2gl.h     C procedure header library
dtimer.c       C timer function, used by both C and Fortran

Files with the suffix .f90 adhere to the Fortran 90 standard, files with

and .h adhere to the C99 standard.

The makefile is setup to use gcc and gfortran with Linux.  A version for
Mac OS X is also in the Makefile, but is commented out.  

Two executables can be created, fbpic2gl for Fortran and cbpic2gl_f for
C.

To compile program, execute:

Make program_name

where program_name is either: fbpic2gl or cbpic2gl_f, or execute:

make

to create both programs.

To execute, type the name of the executable:

./program_name

where program_name is either fbpic2gl or cbpic2gl_f

The file output contains the results produced for the default parameters.

The codes are compiled for double precision by default, but the Fortran
code can be compiled to run in single precision by changing the Makefile
(typically by removing the compiler options flag -r8).

The library bpush2gl_f.c contains wrapper functions to allow the Fortran
library to be called from C.
