This program contains sample codes for illustrating the basic structure
of a 1D Electrostatic Gridless Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code, in Fortran
with C wrappers.  The codes have no diagnosics except for initial and
final energies.  Their primary purpose is to provide example codes for
physical science students learning about PIC codes.  They are also
intended as benchmark reference codes to aid in developing new codes and
in evaluating new computer architectures.

Gridless PIC codes are based on an exact solution of many interacting
particles, based on a fourier series.  The only approximations are a
finite time step and a truncation of the fourier series, as well as
round off errors.  The first gridless code was developed by John Dawson
in the 1960s for electrostatic systems, and is described in 
John M. Dawson, "The Electrostatic Sheet Model for a Plasma and its
Modification to Finite-Size Particles," Methods in Computational
Physics, volume 9, B. Alder, S. Fernback, and M. Rotenburg, Ed.
[Academic Press, New York, 1970, p. 1.

Traditional PIC codes are widely used in plasma physics.  They model
plasmas as particles which interact self-consistently via the
electromagnetic fields they themselves produce.  PIC codes generally
have three important procedures in the main iteration loop.  The first
is the deposit, where some particle quantity, such as a charge, is
accumulated on a grid via interpolation to produce a source density.
The gridless code calculates the fourier co-efficients directly without
using a grid or FFTs.  The second important procedure is the field
solver, which solves Maxwell’s equation or a subset to obtain the
electric and/or magnetic fields from the source densities.  The solver
in the gridless code is the same as a spectral solver in a traditional
PIC code, except that the number of fourier modes used can vary and the
fields remain in fourier space.  In a traditional PIC code, once the
fields are obtained in real space, the particle forces are found by
interpolation from the grid, and the particle co-ordinates are updated,
using Newton’s second law.  The gridless code calculates the electric
field at the particle's location directly from the fourier series
without use of a grid or interpolation.  Updating the particle
co-ordinates is the same as in a traditional PIC code.  The particle
processing parts dominate over the field solving parts in a typical PIC 
application.  The gridless code is MUCH slower than a traditional code,
scaling as the number of particles TIMES the number of fourier modes
retained.  Gridless codes are much more accurate and do not suffer from
aliasing errors.  They are especially useful when unusual errors are
occurring in a traditional PIC code, or for very precise calculations.

More details about traditional PIC codes can be found in the texts by
C. K. Birdsall and A. B. Langdon, Plasma Physics via Computer
Simulation, 1985, R. W. Hockney and J. W. Eastwood, Computer Simulation
Using Particles, 1981, and John M. Dawson, "Particle simulation of
plasmas", Rev. Mod. Phys. 55, 403 (1983).  Details about the
mathematical equations used in the gridless code and units used in this
code is given in the companion article, "Description of Electrostatic
Spectral Code from the UPIC Framework" by Viktor K. Decyk, UCLA, in the
file ESModels.pdf.

No warranty for proper operation of this software is given or implied.

with each file.  If use of these codes results in a publication, an

The code here uses the simplest force, the electrostatic Coulomb
interaction, obtained by solving a Poisson equation.  The boundary
conditions are periodic, only electron species are included.

Particles are initialized with a uniform distribution in space and a
gaussian distribution in velocity space.  This describes a plasma in
thermal equilibrium.  The inner loop contains a charge deposit, a
Poisson solver, and a particle push procedure.  The final energy and
timings are printed.  A sample output file for the default input
parameters is included in the file output.

In more detail, the inner loop of the code contains the following
procedures in Fortran (C):

Deposit section:
   DPOST1GL (cdpost1gl): deposit charge density

Field solve section:
   POIS1GL (cpois1gl): calculate smoothed longitudinal electric field
                       in fourier space.

Particle Push section:
   PUSH1GL (cpush1gl): update particle co-ordinates with smoothed
                       electric field:
                       x(t)->x(t+dt/2); v(t-dt/2)->v(t+dt/2)

The inputs to the code are the grid parameter indx, the particle number
parameter npx, the time parameters tend, dt, the velocity parameters
vtx, vx0, and the fourier mode parameter nxhm.

In more detail:
indx = exponent which determines length in x direction, nx=2**indx.
   This ensurea the system lengths is a power of 2.
npx = number of electrons distributed in x direction.
   The total number of particles in the simulation is npx
tend = time at end of simulation, in units of plasma frequency.
dt = time interval between successive calculations.
   The number of time steps the code runs is given by tend/dt.
vtx = thermal velocity of electrons in x direction
   a typical value is 1.0.
vx0 = drift velocity of electrons in x direction.
nxhm = number of fourier modes kept.

The major program files contained here include:
pic1gl.f90    Fortran90 main program 
pic1gl.c      C main program
push1gl.f     Fortran77 procedure library
push1gl_h.f90 Fortran90 procedure interface (header) library
push1gl_f.c   C wrapper functions for calling the Fortran routines in C
push1gl.h     C procedure header library
dtimer.c      C timer function, used by both C and Fortran

Files with the suffix .f90 adhere to the Fortran 90 standard, files with
the suffix .f adhere to the Fortran77 standard, files with the suffix .c
and .h adhere to the C99 standard.

The makefile is setup to use gcc and gfortran with Linux.  A version for
Mac OS X is also in the Makefile, but is commented out.  

Two executables can be created, fpic1gl for Fortran and cpic1gl_f for C.

To compile program, execute:

Make program_name

where program_name is either: fpic1gl or cpic1gl_f, or execute:

make

to create both programs.

To execute, type the name of the executable:

./program_name

where program_name is either fpic1gl or cpic1gl_f

The file output contains the results produced for the default parameters.

The codes are compiled for double precision by default, but the Fortran
code can be compiled to run in single precision by changing the Makefile
(typically by removing the compiler options flag -r8).

The library push1gl_f.c contains wrapper functions to allow the Fortran
library to be called from C.
